1- download OSSIM.iso and install on the VM

2- then create a new machine on your virtual box

3- you need to configure your new VM 

4- after configuring the ip address of the OSSIM agent, we add a plugin and then click on "Jailbreak this appliance" in order to access the terminal of this vm. 

5- we can also ssh into it from our windows terminal 

6- then we will connect to the web interface and log in with our credentials

7- then we added our zerotier network for it to scan the vulnerabilities

8- Since we only needed to do this for our production environment, I went on and added each of machine on our production environment to the zerotier network and then authorized it from the OSSIM web interface we had on.

(one problem that was encountered was making ossim scan the zerotier network, it was rather scanning the home network)

9- then we ran a vulnerability scan on our network
